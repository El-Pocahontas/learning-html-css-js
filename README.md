# Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This repository contains a collection of small projects and exercises created during my learning journey in frontend development.  
I cover topics such as semantic HTML, responsive layouts, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Folder structure

Each folder represents a lesson or project, named accordingly (e.g. `lesson-01`, `project-flexbox`, etc.).

## Skills practiced

- HTML5 semantics
- CSS basics, Flexbox & Grid
- Media queries & responsive design
- JavaScript basics (DOM manipulation, events, etc.)
